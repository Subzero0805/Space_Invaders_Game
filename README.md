# Space_Invaders_Game

### Programming Language/Libaries: Python3| Pygame | Random

This game enabled me to become familiar with creating games using the "pygame" library.
I was able to develop my understanding of Object Orientated Programming (OOP) and class's can be used to reduce repetative code.

### Improvements:
As I further develop my understanding of OOP, I plan to add more features to the game, such as:
- Alien type:
  - Fast Aliens: The ability to shoot faster bullets that deal less damage, but have a lower amount of health.
  - Gunner Aliens: Aliens that shoot slower and deal more damage, but have a higher amount of health.
- Player Power Ups:
  - Burst Fire: The player can now shoot in bursts of 3.
  - Damage Increase: The players bullets now deal more damage.
  - Health restore: Restores the player's health to full.
- Sound:
  - SFX: Add sounds when bullets are fired, power ups are collected and bullets hit enemies.
